# tdt-sentiment-classification
This repository contains Python notebooks to reproduce various experiments of an on-going sentiment annotation and classification project at TurkuNLP. Many of the experiments make use of a Finnish sentiment classification data set that is under development. Some experiments also use the XED data set (https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/XED).

The repository root contains the key results, while other experiments are in the `other` directory. To reproduce the results, set the correct file paths at the top of the notebook, then run all the cells in order.
