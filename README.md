# tdt-sentiment-classification
This repository contains Python notebooks to reproduce key experiments of an on-going sentiment annotation and classification project at TurkuNLP. Most of the experiments make use of a Finnish sentiment classification data set that is under development. A few experiments also use the XED data set (https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/XED).
